# UBI-Labor-Supply-Simulation
Final project modeling labor supply response to UBI using Python
# UBI Labor Supply Simulation

Final project for ECON E402: Computational Methods in Macroeconomics at Indiana University.

##Overview
Simulates labor supply response to different UBI levels using income elasticity.  
Plots visual impact of rising UBI on work hours.  
Built in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Key Formula
Labor Change (%) = -Elasticity × (UBI / Income) × 100
